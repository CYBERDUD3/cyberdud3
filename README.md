## Hi there, I'm [Abhijith!](https://github.com/CYBERDUD3/resume) ðŸ‘‹

Adroit Python wizard with an innate love of writing code to solve complex issues, I've been programming since the age of 14. I taught myself to code through reading books and managed to develop a scientific calculator using C++ at the age of 15. My love for innovative and creative client applications is what allowed me to become a passionate web developer. In my role as a programmer, I not only rely on coding competencies, but also on my significant leadership skills.

I'm also a mentor, I love to teach programming, especially programming with Python. I'm also volunteering for Facebook Developer Circle Trivandrum as Data Science Facilitator since the beginning of 2020. I love figuring out how someone sees their world, their problems, and then help fill in the gaps. Through mentoring, I accelerate my own constant learning, because there is always something that you want to do better when teaching that knowledge to others!

I see programming as art. Code is expression. It needs to have clarity, purpose, elegance and efficiency to communicate well, to execute well. As a result, I produce software of the highest quality, not only functional and tested, but highly readable for future maintainers.
